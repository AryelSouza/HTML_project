		<p>
			We are UNES—extended to the world for every type of adult learner. We serve students seeking part-time, online courses and nonresidential programs to advance their career or pursue an academic passion.<br>

We are a fully accredited UNES school. Our degrees and certificates are adorned with the UNES University insignia. They carry the weight of that lineage. Our graduates walk at University commencement and become members of the UNES Alumni Association.<br>

As one of 12 degree-granting institutions at UNES University, we teach to the largest and most eclectic student body. Our students come to us from every time zone, every culture and career background, every age from 18 to 89.<br>

Our students have one thing in common: the motivation to take the next challenging step in their lives. They find that challenge here, where our academic standards are high and our resources extensive.
